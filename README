Tweetscape.

Dependencies:
py-MySQLdb
tweepy (included in source... for now)


To do:

Refine that sampler
Write an indexer to process the flow of information, fast.
Note to self: Geocoding API:
http://maps.google.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=Seattle,+WA&sensor=false

Further ideas to implement:

A live map showing the location of tweets in the, say, last 15 minutes.
But how ah, maybe store the coordinates+timestamp in the memory/separate database then do the summing?

Yep, oyasumi~
